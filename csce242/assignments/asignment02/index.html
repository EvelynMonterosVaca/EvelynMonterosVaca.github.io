        <h2 id="them"> About Them</h2>
        <p>Hey there! Let me tell you about Stray Kids, an amazing eight-member South Korean 
            boy band from JYP Entertainment. The group is made up of Bang Chan, Lee Know, Changbin, 
            Hyunjin, Han, Felix, Seungmin, and I.N. They first burst onto the scene in 2018 with their 
            catchy song "District 9" from their EP *I Am Not*. What's really cool is that Bang Chan, 
            who is the oldest member and trained the longest at JYP, handpicked each member to join him 
            on this exciting journey! <br>
            <br>
            At first, there were nine members during a survival show, but in October 2019, one member 
            decided to leave for personal reasons. <br>
            <br>
            Stray Kids is super special because they mainly produce their music themselves! They have 
            an awesome production team called 3Racha, made up of Bang Chan, Changbin, and Han. The other 
            members also jump in on songwriting to add their own flair. <br>
            <br>
            As for their name, "Stray Kids" started out as a metaphor for a lost child chasing their 
            dreams. Over time, it has grown to symbolize the idea of finding a way out of the ordinary 
            together. <br>
            <br>
            In 2020, Stray Kids excitedly made their Japanese debut with awesome Japanese versions of 
            "My Pace," "Double Knot," and "Levanter." They then released their very first full Japanese 
            single, "Top," along with the catchy B-side, "Slump." Both of these tracks were featured in the 
            anime "Tower of God," with "Top" serving as the opening theme and "Slump" as the ending theme. 
            Plus, fans were thrilled when a Korean version of "Top" came out on May 13, followed by an English 
            version on May 20. These days, you can enjoy most of their songs in Korean and Japanese, and there 
            are even a few in English! <br> 
            <br>
            Stray Kids are taking the world by storm! They’ve snagged some amazing awards, including the Top 
            Global K-pop Artist at the Billboard Music Awards in 2024. In 2023, they won the MTV Video Music 
            Award for Best K-pop, and this year, they were recognized with the People’s Choice Award for Group/Duo 
            of the Year and the iHeartRadio Music Award. Plus, they received a Grammy nomination for Best Compilation 
            Soundtrack for Visual Media for their awesome song "SLASH," featured on the Deadpool & Wolverine soundtrack. 
        </p>

        <h2 id="music"> About Their Music</h2>
        <p>Stray Kids is an exciting K-pop group that also loves to mix in hip-hop and electronic vibes! Their music pulls 
            inspiration from a variety of genres, such as hip-hop, dubstep, heavy metal, electroclash, and dance-pop, resulting 
            in a sound that’s both unique and adventurous. Many describe their songs as "dark and experimental," which adds to 
            their charm. <br>
            <br>
            You might enjoy tracks like "LALALALA," "S-Class," and "Social Path," but don't forget to check out their softer, 
            more emotional tunes like "Silent Cry," "Close," and "Sorry, I Love You" as well.  <br>
            <br>
            What’s really cool is that Stray Kids often dive into themes of identity, love, and heartbreak in their music. 
            Plus, they have the talent and creativity to produce their own songs, making their artistry even more special!</p>
