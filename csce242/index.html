        <p>In this course, we're going to have a great time exploring 
            the basics of web development! We'll start by learning how 
            to use HTML and CSS to design and structure a website, all 
            while following some fun guidelines. Then, we'll spice things
             up with interactive features using JavaScript, creating a 
             dynamic experience for our users. Plus, weâ€™ll dive into the 
             world of Node.js and server-side JavaScript, which will help 
             us store and retrieve data from a server, setting the stage 
             for more exciting and data-driven web applications. Let's get
              started on this journey together!</p>
