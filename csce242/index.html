                    <p>For my first assignment, I put together a fun website using basic HTML code to explore the wonderful 
                        world of crochet and basic stitches! I’ve included some of my favorite projects with pictures of two 
                        of my creations. You'll also find a handy table that walks you through the steps for different basic 
                        stitches. Plus, I’ve added links to some awesome YouTube videos that show how to do these stitches. 
                        I hope you enjoy checking it out! </p>

                    <p> For assignment two, we had a lot of fun using CSS to give our website a fresh look! We explored how 
                        to use IDs and classes, and even learned some neat tricks for styling divs. My website is all about 
                        Stray Kids and their amazing music. It shares who they are, along with reviews of their songs. You’ll 
                        also find links to their awesome music videos! Plus, there's a cool table at the end that highlights 
                        each member of the group. </p>

                    <p> For our third assignment, we’re diving into creating a website that looks great! We’ve been learning 
                        about Flexbox, which is a super handy tool for designing layouts. Following the outline we received, 
                        we’ll have fun designing the website to show off two different looks using Flexbox. Let’s get creative!</p>
