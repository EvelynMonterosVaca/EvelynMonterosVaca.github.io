                    <p>For my first assignment, I put together a fun website using basic HTML code to explore the wonderful 
                        world of crochet and basic stitches! I’ve included some of my favorite projects with pictures of two 
                        of my creations. You'll also find a handy table that walks you through the steps for different basic 
                        stitches. Plus, I’ve added links to some awesome YouTube videos that show how to do these stitches. 
                        I hope you enjoy checking it out! </p>

                    <p> For assignment two, we had a lot of fun using CSS to give our website a fresh look! We explored how 
                        to use IDs and classes, and even learned some neat tricks for styling divs. My website is all about 
                        Stray Kids and their amazing music. It shares who they are, along with reviews of their songs. You’ll 
                        also find links to their awesome music videos! Plus, there's a cool table at the end that highlights 
                        each member of the group. </p>

                    <p> For our third assignment, we’re diving into creating a website that looks great! We’ve been learning 
                        about Flexbox, which is a super handy tool for designing layouts. Following the outline we received, 
                        we’ll have fun designing the website to show off two different looks using Flexbox. Let’s get creative!

                    <p>This assignment focuses on the task of recreating the College of Arts and Sciences webpage for the 
                        University of South Carolina. Our goal is to carefully examine the original webpage's layout, design 
                        elements, and content structure. After this analysis, we will replicate the page using placeholder text 
                        and random content to mimic the look and feel of the original site. This exercise will help us better 
                        understand web design principles and enhance our skills in creating visually appealing and organized 
                        web content.</p>

                    <a href="assignments/assignment05/index.html"><img src="images/assig05.jpg"></a>
                    <p>For this assignment, I got a super helpful outline that guided me in recreating the project using HTML, 
                        CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create an interactive experience where clicking on different parts 
                        of the webpage would reveal fun things, like a cheerful greeting message, a lively change in background 
                        color, and a selection of images to make everything more visually appealing. The outline was great for 
                        keeping me on track, but it also gave me the freedom to get creative with the color theme.

                    <p>For this assignment, we were provided with a specific layout to follow. When Exercise 1 is clicked, the 
                        "Traveling" section will appear while the "Picture Chooser" will be hidden. Conversely, when Exercise 2, 
                        "Picture Chooser," is clicked, the opposite will occur. In the "Traveling" section, we needed to include 
                        images that would change based on a specific word entered in the text box. In the "Picture Chooser," a 
                        white hat will change colors when clicking on either the red, green, or blue button.
